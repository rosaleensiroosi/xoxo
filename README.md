# xoxo
this p5.js application gives you kisses at the click of a mouse... what can possibly be better than that?! &lt;3

# what i learned:
- the importance of preloading (the images and the font)
- how to import fonts and write words using the p5.js language
- push() and pop(): start a new drawing phase by using push(), end it w/ pop(), and place transformation code in between.
